## Explicit examples

| Audience  | Context | Details |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Politicians** | [“FBK”](https://fbk.info) is a key organisation behind opposition candidate Navalny. They key members live in European Union, but thousands of supporters still live in Russia. | Opposition network related to the “FBK” prefers to anonymise their partners in Russia. First of all, because working with the “foreign agent” is a risk of being prosecuted, secondly it could reveal supporters’ identities. “FBK” supporters are perceived by the current Russian government as a key political opponents, so they actively use law enforcement & surveillence actions against them.| 
| **Artists** | [“Art doc fest”](https://artdocfest.com/en/) is an international documentary film festival help in Russia. It’s was cancelled in Moscow due to its political position & sharp visual storytelling. | Today festival is held in Riga, but many Russian documentary filmmakers prefer to stay anonymous to protect themselves, film crew & their families. Their visual stories are considered a threat by the Russian government. |
| **Famous people** | Many public figures like C-level executives of the NASDAQ-traded companies, actors, opinion leaders prefers to support NGOs, activists & opposition anonymously. | **Reason**: By using “framing” technique Russia could use their support in social media scandal creation. This could negatively affect “donor” & company public image.|
| **Foreign agent** | Every donation from abroad could be used as to frame recipient as a foreign agent. Even when the case is a donation to animal shelter or domestic violence’ victim center.  | Privacy is a #1 priority within the crypto donation track. |
| **Media** | Foreign media actively work with the network of freelancers in Russia from cameramen to journalists. They cover a wide range of tasks from key events documentation to investigative journalism. | Protection is a key priority within the media operations. Because all those freelancers could be prosecuted by the law enforcement agents. |
| **Ethnical minorities** | Crimean Tatars are ethnical minority living in Crimea peninsula occupied by Russia since 2014. They are active supporters of Ukraine & perceive Crimea as an occupied territory. So Russian government perform surveillance & oppressive actions against them. | Privacy tools could help Crimean Tatars to maintain their ethnical culture, develop fund for a legal support, scale network of their operations & survive under a harsh conditions. |
