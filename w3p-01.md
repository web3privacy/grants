# Context 

**Context**: Research on how private web3-solutions are used within the Ukrainian-Russian war (with a focus on privacy-protecting currencies like Zcash).

**Important notes**:
**Privacy of the general public is under attack**
[OONI](https://ooni.org/post/2023-russia-a-year-after-the-conflict/): "In March 2022, the State Duma and the Federation Council quickly adopted amendments to the Criminal Code. According to the amendments, spreading fake news about military actions, calling for sanctions, and discrediting the Russian armed forces faces will be followed by penalties ranging from a fine of 100,000 rubles to 15 years in prison, for example:

- A fine of 100,000 rubles will be charged “for actions aimed at discrediting the RF Armed Forces, including for public calls to obstruct the use of the armed forces of the Russian Federation.”
- 15 years in prison for spreading fakes about the use of the Russian armed forces, if they entailed serious consequences.
In addition, articles 207.1 and 207.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation are in force, according to which the dissemination of unreliable socially significant information (e.g., about the depreciation of the ruble, the collapse of the economy or default) can be also followed by charges."

_Roskomnadzor indicated that to cover the Russian military actions in Ukraine only information and data from official Russian sources should be used. Roskomnadzor prohibited naming the “special operation” an attack, an invasion, or a war. Thus, any information that was not obtained from a Russian official source, such as the Ministry of Defense, should be considered fake. In addition to the obvious violation of the provisions of the Russian Constitution and of the laws “On Mass Media”, both of which prohibit censorship._

_In 2022, Network Freedoms counted 779 cases of criminal charges brought for statements on the network (posts, reposts, statuses on social networks and messengers). This is the annual maximum for 15 years of observations, according to the project’s annual report on Internet freedom in Russia._

# Explicit cases

| Audience  | Context | Details |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Politicians** | [“FBK”](https://fbk.info) is a key organisation behind opposition candidate Navalny. They key members live in European Union, but thousands of supporters still live in Russia. | Opposition network related to the “FBK” prefers to anonymise their partners in Russia. First of all, because working with the “foreign agent” is a risk of being prosecuted, secondly it could reveal supporters’ identities. “FBK” supporters are perceived by the current Russian government as a key political opponents, so they actively use law enforcement & surveillence actions against them.| 
| **Artists** | [“Art doc fest”](https://artdocfest.com/en/) is an international documentary film festival help in Russia. It’s was cancelled in Moscow due to its political position & sharp visual storytelling. | Today festival is held in Riga, but many Russian documentary filmmakers prefer to stay anonymous to protect themselves, film crew & their families. Their visual stories are considered a threat by the Russian government. |
| **Famous people** | Many public figures like C-level executives of the NASDAQ-traded companies, actors, opinion leaders prefers to support NGOs, activists & opposition anonymously. | **Reason**: By using “framing” technique Russia could use their support in social media scandal creation. This could negatively affect “donor” & company public image.|
| **Foreign agent** | Every donation from abroad could be used as to frame recipient as a foreign agent. Even when the case is a donation to animal shelter or domestic violence’ victim center.  | Privacy is a #1 priority within the crypto donation track. |
| **Media** | Foreign media actively work with the network of freelancers in Russia from cameramen to journalists. They cover a wide range of tasks from key events documentation to investigative journalism. | Protection is a key priority within the media operations. Because all those freelancers could be prosecuted by the law enforcement agents. |
| **Ethnical minorities** | [Crimean Tatars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Tatar_diaspora) are ethnical minority living in Crimea peninsula occupied by Russia since 2014. They are active supporters of Ukraine & perceive Crimea as an occupied territory. So Russian government perform surveillance & oppressive actions against them. | Privacy tools could help Crimean Tatars to maintain their ethnical culture, develop fund for a legal support, scale network of their operations & survive under a harsh conditions. |
| **Ukrainian journalists** | Freedom House. Freedom of the net report: "Following the Russian invasion, journalists in Ukraine have faced extreme danger due to Russian attacks while conducting their work. According to rights experts at the United Nations, journalists have been “targeted, tortured, kidnapped, attacked, and killed, or refused safe passage” from cities and regions under Russian siege. At least eight journalists, including online journalists, were killed by Russian forces during the coverage period... The Institute of Mass Information (IMI), by the end of May 2022, had recorded [280 crimes against journalists](https://imi.org.ua/en/monitorings/280-crimes-against-journalists-and-the-media-in-ukraine-committed-by-russia-in-three-months-of-war-i45745) and media in Ukraine committed by Russian forces". |
