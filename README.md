# ❏ Privacy Beat
## Ranking system of all privacy-related projects in the Web3

Privacy is a top priority in the era of web, an essential human right. Web3privacy now would create a scoring mechanism (both professional & communal) to provide unbiased tools for assessing projects & helping users through education, raising our collective privacy literacy.

## ✵ Scoring mechanism: 
We'll reserach and develop a unique privacy scoring mechanism & create a tool with the help of privacy experts from the Ethereum Foundation, NYM and others while building on the experiene of active members from both solar and lunarpunk communities. The goal is to collectively raise the maturity of privacy products & services accross all layers of the technology stack.

In parallel to the top-down scorecard method, we'll develop and implement a bottom-up community scoring platform too (think of Metacritic exters + users scorings). We believe that at the end of the day it's the users who have to become the real watchdogs of the industry, signaling about flaws and shortcomings of solutions.

Professional scoring would be a joint R&D with the key web3 people from protocol architects to security specialists. This will help to create an unbiased take from scratch & enabling a transparent working process, accessible to everyone via a forum.

## ✵ Privacy services database:
The biggest privacy services database with the latest R&D tracks from Privacy & Scaling explorations to Chainsafe proposals. Highly helpful to everyone exploring & researching cutting-edge of the privacy stack (including builders & hackathon-enablers).

Access it here: https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy

## ✵ Privacy guides: 
Extensive privacy guides covering broad audiences from Iranian human rights activists to Ukrainian people living on occupied territories.

Practical guides will match:

- existing privacy solutions from Sismo to NYM with privacy-personas (NGOs, anon donors, activists).
- non-tech people with accessible privacy solutions (with the focus on human rights & sensitive audiences)
- tech-people with advanced privacy solutions & practices

## Deliverables:
- scoring model v 1.0 + expert validation
- basic functionality mapping (incl. UX/UI research), copywriting, basic brand design system, scoring model applicability to all existing privacy-preserving web3 projects (300+ projects).

## Timings
