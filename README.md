# ⌬ Privacy Annual Report 2023

Following our [Privacy Market Overview](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy/blob/main/Market%20overview/Privacy%20market%20outlook%20in%20Web3%20by%20Mykola%20Siusko%20(Jan%202023).pdf)(Jan 2023) we intend to produce an Annual Report to showcase privacy's state of the art. 

The idea consist into structure the overall picture of the web3-privacy market exploring hundreds of independent companies and their connections with the potential for unity and collaboration. 

### Why is it important now? 
Regulators actively centralise the market. Moreover, while multiple agents are watching you, exchanges and wallets give you a sense of freedom of choice ("to KYC or not to KYC"). Analytics companies own & use your data without permission. Leaked news about the regulation of private cryptocurrencies and the Tornado Cash sanctions are a clear examples of why privacy needs advocacy.

Let's stop fighing each other for the best feature, protocol or chain and find common ground to build a better web. Together.

# ✵ Privacy Beat
## Ranking system of all privacy-related projects in the Web3

<img width="1129" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-28 at 16 26 46" src="https://github.com/web3privacy/grants/assets/101947219/8c0aeabe-8ab4-4ef4-b1aa-0c8390318418">

Privacy is a top priority in the era of web, an essential human right. Drived by this we are creating a platform to help the general public understand whether a web3-service is private or not. 

To do so we are developing a unique scoring mechanism (both professional & communal) to provide unbiased tools for assessing projects & helping users.  

### Readiness
- Data: 90%
- Platform: 75%
- Scoring Mechanism: 45%

- [Live Demo](https://taikai.network/ethrome/hackathons/ethrome-23/projects/clng508ts00lswu01030hpfuq/idea)

## Scoring Mechanism: 
We are working on a unique privacy scoring mechanism & create a tool with the help of privacy experts from the Ethereum Foundation, Railgun, Waku, NYM and others while building on the experiene of active members from both solar and lunarpunk communities. 

Professional scoring would be a joint R&D with the key web3 people from protocol architects to security specialists. This will help to create an unbiased take from scratch & enabling a transparent working process, accessible to everyone via a forum.

In parallel to the top-down scorecard method, we'll develop and implement a bottom-up community scoring platform too (think of Metacritic exters + users scorings) -> at the end of the day it's the users who have to become the real watchdogs of the industry, signaling about flaws and shortcomings of solutions.

We interviewed 100 privacy players & gathered an MVP vision — we are running a series of 1-on-1 feedback loop sessions to make the scoring model community validated.

### Deliverables:
- scoring model v 1.0 + expert validation
- basic functionality mapping (incl. UX/UI research), copywriting, basic brand design system, scoring model applicability to all existing privacy-preserving web3 projects (300+ projects).

### Timings
- MVP > 3 months

### Breakdown:
- Scoring modeling: 3 weeks+
- Product management (UX, copy, scoring aplicability, design): 1 month
- Web-development + testing: 1 month
