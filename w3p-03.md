# Context 

90%+ of the privacy services in web3 lack basic security audit. High risk for anyone using them without a third-party attestation.
At the same time, security audit companies aren't focused on privacy features but analyze smart contracts etc. So we want to increase the "security" levelling of the privacy services by facilitating new kinds of Privacy features attestation by white hackers (working for companies or themselves).

This will significantly protect the general public from compromised services with backdoors, poor code execution & false privacy claims. Meanwhile, it will prove privacy claims from the broader community, contributing to the latest encryption, ZK-research & other privacy-tech execution concepts.
